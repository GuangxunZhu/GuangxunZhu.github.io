I am currently a third-year graduate student at [Hunan University](http://www.hnu.edu.cn/) in Changsha, China, supervised by [Prof. Fengjun Chen](http://robotics.hnu.edu.cn/info/1071/1162.htm). My master's thesis focuses on researching cross-camera multi-object tracking algorithms and their applications in track cycling events. Before this, I obtained my bachelor's degree in Vehicle Engineering from [Southwest Jiaotong University](https://www.swjtu.edu.cn/) in Chengdu, China in 2021. In July 2022, I had the opportunity to work with [Prof. Jinqiao Wang](http://www.nlpr.ia.ac.cn/iva/homepage/jqwang/index.htm) and Prof. Chaoyang Zhao at the [Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CASIA)](http://ia.cas.cn/), where we explored multi-object tracking, multi-task learning, and re-identification.
