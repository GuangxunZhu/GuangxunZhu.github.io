The project aims to develop a Multi-camera multi-object tracking system to collect information about participants in keirin cycle race.

Introduction
======
Three cameras are set up at the circular Keirin race track, with each camera's field of view covering the starting line, the 50-meter line, and the 150-meter line, respectively. Using the collected race videos, a cross-camera multi-object tracking method is designed to determine the lap count, position, ranking, race time, sprint time, interval velocity, and other relevant information for each participating athlete.

Responsibilities
======
* Constructed a multi-object tracking model and trained and tested it.
* Researched multi-object tracking algorithms and multitask learning within the JDE (Joint Detection and Embedding) framework.
* Designed a cross-camera matching algorithm.
* Designed a logical method for outputting athlete information based on tracking results.
* Defined the interfaces for web deployment.
